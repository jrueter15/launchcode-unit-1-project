            Why I Made This
        </h2>
        <p>
            Like many, I’ve always had the desire to be better — more consistent, more focused, more fulfilled. But no matter how hard I tried, I often fell short. Motivation alone wasn’t enough, especially as life became more demanding with a new job and an intensive coding program.

            This project provided an opportunity to pause and reflect — not just on what I was building, but why I hadn’t been progressing the way I wanted to. What was missing wasn’t effort — it was a system. A way to mark progress, even when it felt small or invisible.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Purpose
        </h2>

        <p>
            This app is the product of that reflection. Inspired by the book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, it’s built around one simple but transformative principle: small, consistent actions compound into meaningful change. You don’t need a dramatic life overhaul — you just need to add one dot today. Then another tomorrow. Then another. Then another.
        </p>
        <br></br>

        <h2>
            The Mission
        </h2>

        <p>
            The goal of this app is simple:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <ul>
            <li>Create a calm, judgment-free space to log small daily wins - your daily dot.</li>
            <li>Build momentum through repetition.</li>
            <li>Redefine your identity, one small action at a time.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <p>
            Whether your win is meditating for one minute, resisting the urge to scroll, or simply showing up — it counts here.

            This is for anyone trying to change quietly, not loudly. Patiently, not perfectly. I built it for myself - to start connecting the dots - and maybe it can help you, too.
